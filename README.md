This is my setup file for new Macs which includes all of my favourite tools for developing software and all of my favourite apps.

## Use It
1. Download the [Brewfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidhariri/mac-config/main/Brewfile) from this repository
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
3. Run `brew bundle install` from the directory you downloaded the file to (cd ~/Downloads)

## Make Your Own
You can make your own Brewfile by running `brew bundle dump`. For more details on how this all works, check out [@ChristopherA's post](https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/a579274536aab36ea9966f301ff14f3f).
